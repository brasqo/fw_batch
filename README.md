# fw_batch

(worst) READ_ME (ever):
Written originally for a Win machine. Can use on Linux/Mac with some tweaks to the paths and the constant strings (make variable)..

Designed to take a csv of exe names and exe paths, and creates a batch script of firewall rules to be applied in mass to Win machine that utilizes standard built-in Windows FireWall.

Originally intended as a "one-off" script for a CSV that had over 450 lines of data. May possibly build more on it to become more practical
